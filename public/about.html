<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kristen and I am glad to have you on my portfolio website! I am just beginning to study web development 
  and this will be used to showcase what I have learned :)</p>

<p>While this is very basic HTML (yes I know, nothing fancy to see here...YET), I will continue to develop my skills over time.
  As I begin to learn other aspects of HTML and eventually CSS and JavaScript, my websites will begin to look more professional and polished.

<p>I am glad you are here to see my journey from a complete NOOB to hopefully soon enough...a proficient web developer in the making. Thank you!</p>
